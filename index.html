      <h2>About the Scholarship</h2>
      <p>
        The Driftless Riders Scholarship is a public benefit corporation organized exclusively for charitable and educational purposes under Iowa Code Sections 504.141(34) and 504.1705(3). Our mission is to raise and distribute scholarship funds to support youth in Northeast Iowa in learning, developing, and sustaining equestrian skills—particularly those who might not otherwise have access to such opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Driftless Riders Scholarship Fund was created to open the barn doors to all—supporting passionate and/or aspiring riders who might not otherwise have access to lessons. Our goal is to make equestrian sports more inclusive, one ride at a time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="apply">
      <h2>How to Apply</h2>
      <p>
        Scholarships are available to youth riders in the Driftless area who demonstrate both a strong interest in equestrian activities and a clear financial need. Applicants should be passionate about learning and improving their horsemanship skills and may be involved in any riding discipline. Applicants should be planning to actively participate in a structured riding, driving, or horsemanship program with formal instruction—such as lessons at an established riding school, with a certified trainer/clinician, or through a recognized equine/youth organization. Informal arrangements (e.g., casual riding with a neighbor’s horse or unstructured lease programs without formal instruction) do not meet the eligibility requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application process includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A short questionnaire covering basic personal information, riding experience, and goals.</li>
        <li>A personal statement (approximately 300–500 words) where applicants can share their story, describe their interest in horses, outline how the scholarship would help them, and explain any barriers they face in accessing riding opportunities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>All application materials must be submitted by November 15.</strong><br>
      Scholarships will be reviewed by the Board, and recipients will be notified by December 1.</p>

      <h2>What Horses Mean to Us</h2>

      <div class="testimonial">
        <p>“Riding has opened up so many new experiences and opportunities for me, and I've fully enjoyed it. I find being around horses empowering and fulfilling.” – Roxie, age 12</p>
      </div>

      <div class="testimonial">
        <p>“The barn has not only been a place where I learned how to be a confident and competent rider but my experiences truly shaped me as a person. Not only have I made valuable friendships, I have made some of my favorite memories because of Anne-Marine’s lesson program. Taking a young horse to our first cross country clinic, galloping through fields, and teaching young children about horses are just a few of some of my favorite days at the barn.” – Hannah, age 18</p>
      </div>

      <div class="testimonial">
        <p>“Riding has strengthened me both physically and mentally. I grow in confidence each time I ride. Learning to care for the horse both in the barn and in the arena, shows me the importance of respect, patience and responsibility.” – Ivy, age 12</p>
      </div>

      <div class="testimonial">
        <p>“Horse riding is my happy place. By riding horses, I've learned that hard work pays off, but it doesn't come easy. Even when I have a bad day at school or I just don't feel like going to my lesson, I am able to push those feelings away and focus on my lesson. By the end of my lesson, whatever was bothering me before my lesson doesn't seem like such a big deal anymore. That's the impact of riding horses.” – Anya, age 13</p>
