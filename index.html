            <h2>What Horses Mean to Us</h2>
            <blockquote>
                “Riding has strengthened me both physically and mentally. I grow in confidence each time I ride. Learning to care for the horse both in the barn and in the arena, shows me the importance of respect, patience and responsibility.”  
                <br>— Ivy, age 12
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                “Horse riding is my happy place. By riding horses, I've learned that hard work pays off, but it doesn't come easy. Even when I have a bad day at school or I just don't feel like going to my lesson, I am able to push those feelings away and focus on my lesson. By the end of my lesson, whatever was bothering me before my lesson doesn't seem like such a big deal anymore. That's the impact of riding horses.”  
                <br>— Anya, age 13
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                “Horses have taught me patience, dedication, and the value of hard work. They have been my teachers, my partners, and my friends.”  
                <br>— Current Team Member
