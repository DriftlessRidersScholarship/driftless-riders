      <h2>About the Scholarship</h2>
      <p>
        The Driftless Riders Scholarship is a public benefit corporation organized exclusively for charitable and educational purposes under Iowa Code Sections 504.141(34) and 504.1705(3). Our mission is to raise and distribute scholarship funds to support youth in Northeast Iowa in learning, developing, and sustaining equestrian skills—particularly those who might not otherwise have access to such opportunities.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Apply</h2>
      <p>
        Scholarships are available to youth riders in the Driftless area who demonstrate both a strong interest in equestrian activities and a clear financial need. Applicants should be passionate about learning and improving their horsemanship skills and may be involved in any riding discipline. Applicants should be planning to actively participate in a structured riding, driving, or horsemanship program with formal instruction—such as lessons at an established riding school, with a certified trainer/clinician, or through a recognized equine/youth organization. Informal arrangements (e.g., casual riding with a neighbor’s horse or unstructured lease programs without formal instruction) do not meet the eligibility requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application process includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A short questionnaire covering basic personal information, riding experience, and goals.</li>
        <li>A personal statement (approximately 300–500 words) where applicants can share their story, describe their interest in horses, outline how the scholarship would help them, and explain any barriers they face in accessing riding opportunities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>All application materials must be submitted by November 15.</strong><br>
      Scholarships will be reviewed by the Board, and recipients will be notified by December 1.</p>
